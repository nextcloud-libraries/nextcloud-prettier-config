# Nextcloud Prettier configuration

This provides a shared configuration for Nextcloud apps and libraries to have consistent stylistic rules.
Using stylistic rules in linters is not recommended as linters are for finding bugs while prettier is for code style.
Moreover ESLint and StyleLint both deprecate and remove stylistic rules, as a replacement using Prettier is recommended.

## Setup

### Prepare ESLint

If you are using ESLint you should enable the `eslint-config-prettier` configuration which disables all ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier.
A detailed description can be found here: [github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

In short, this should be your ESLint config:

```json
{
	"extends": [
		"@nextcloud",
		"prettier" // < this needs to be the last one to override all previous
	]
}
```

If you still get errors about Vue files, you need to adjust your ESLint config like the following:
_(this will be fixed once the Nextcloud ESLint config support flat configs)_

```json
"extends": [
		"@nextcloud",
		"prettier"
	],
	"overrides": [
		{
			"files": ["**/*.vue"],
			"rules": {
				"vue/first-attribute-linebreak": "off"
			}
		}
	]
```

### Prepare StyleLint

Stylelint already removed all stylistic rules, so make sure to use `@nextcloud/stylelint-config` **3+** together with `stylelint` 16+.

### Configure Prettier

Install this configuration using:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @nextcloud/prettier-config
```

Either configure Prettier within your `package.json`:

```json
{
	"name": "nextcloud-app",
	"version": "1.33.7",
	"prettier": "@nextcloud/prettier-config"
}
```

Or in a dedicated `.prettierrc.json`:

```json
"@nextcloud/prettier-config"
```

You should create a `.prettierignore` file in your project root to allow simply using `prettier .` or `prettier --write .`, the format is very similar to `.gitignore`. For a Nextcloud app the file could look like this:

```shell
# version control systems directories
**/.git
**/.svn
**/.hg

# 3rdparty dependencies
**/node_modules
**/vendor

# Compiled JS output
js/

# PHP
lib/
**/*.php
```
